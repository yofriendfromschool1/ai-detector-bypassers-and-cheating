Prompt 6: write like Shakespeare
prompt 7: write like (any good writer or human)
prompt 8: use high burstiness and high perplexity.
prompt 9: use high burstiness and high perplexity, write more human-like, don't use unnecessary words and phrases, don't do wording/any big words that only an person in college or writer would know, can use professional writers like Mark Twain, Hemingway, and Shakespeare or anymore writers as an example, and make it have 0% in AI detectors. (use with claude or chatgpt for best results.)

LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THATS NOT ON HERE PUT IN ISSUES AND I WILL ADD AND APPROVE OF IT ALSO ALWAYS CHECK FOR AI DONT JUST ASSUME
Always use ai detectors before btw.

Best (in my opinion/researched)
AI Detectors:
 Paid: Originality.ai, Copyleaks, Turnitin AI (bad reviews tbh not rlly recommended btw js put here), Winston AI, GPTZero
 Free: ZeroGPT, GPTZero, Sapling.ai
AI:
 Paid/Free: Claude (most human sounding),X/Twitter/Grok ai(sounds more like the current generation/gen z), Gemini (Googles ai best research/med), ChatGPT (idk everything ig)
AI Bypassers/Humanizers:
Paid: TwainGPT, Cognibypass,  Humbot, BypassGPT
Free: Humbot, Hix.ai, Rephrasy, UnAIMyText, GPTInf, BypassGPT, make ai use your old writing so send it and train it on your writing the more you give of your writing the better, or could be the 0% or lowest percent ai detected written content you have as well.

NOTE: if an AI bypasser doesn't work try using it over and over again like copy the still ai detected text but put it back into the ai bypasser and regenerate again and keep doing it until you get 0% should work with almost all ai bypasses (only tried with undetectable.aipro btw but should work with most if not all)

What I personally do, if its a research assignment use Gemini Deep Search then copy that text put into claude have it rewrite it using prompt 9 then you could get it to rewrite it again using the same prompt, than use twaingpt with English (US) and basic level twice and it should be 0% to really check I use originality.ai, ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and sapling.ai.

NOTEEEEEEEEEEEE:
if what you are looking for is paid but, your a college student or student with an student email address that ends in .edu then, these have discounts:
